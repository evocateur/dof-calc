DepthOfField for iPhone
=======================

To install, navigate to [http://dof.evocateur.org/](http://dof.evocateur.org/) and press the "+" in the center of the bottom bar, then "Add to Home Screen". Confirm the name (which fits just barely), and now you'll have all the depth-of-field calculations you could ever dream of, regardless of network connection.

This was mostly a project to give me an excuse to deepen my knowledge about iPhone web application patterns, as well as tickle my newfound photographic itch. The thrill of having an icon on my home screen that I "made", well, that doesn't hurt either. :D

Big Thanks To...

   Click on his picture [here][5], I guarantee a bucket of laughs.

 - [Create an Aperture Style Camera Lens Icon][3] tutorial on [VectorTuts+][4].  
   It's such a purty image, I couldn't resist a little hackery in Pixelmator.
